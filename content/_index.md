**Learn** from the analysis tutorials that show how to use the BMEG to do:

 - Gene/Drug Sensitivity Associations
 - Mutation linked Literature Searches
 - Cancer Survival Plots
 - Pathway Analysis

The graph can be explore programmatically using the GRIP API and the Python client. [Credentials and API](/analyze/getting_started)

The entire stack of the BMEG, is openly avalible for you to use, fork and develop on yourself.
